# üîå Household Power Consumption Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting household electricity usage using historical time series data. It leverages a modular, production-ready Python framework for building, training, and deploying a machine learning model to predict **Global Active Power** consumption.

## üìà Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a time series regression model that can forecast the **Global Active Power** usage of a household based on historical readings. The pipeline handles data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction in a clean, maintainable structure. The final model can be deployed via a web interface for real-time prediction.
